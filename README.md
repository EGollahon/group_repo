## Description of Client
Rachael owns a coffee shop in Indianapolis, Indiana. She is a 32 year old single woman, living in the Northeast area of Indianapolis. In her undergraduate years at IUPUI, where she majored in business, she spent her time studying with friends at various coffee shops. She opened her own shop, hoping that other students and people in the community would be able to experience the comfort and joy of the shop. She wishes to reach more customers by giving her business an online presence.
